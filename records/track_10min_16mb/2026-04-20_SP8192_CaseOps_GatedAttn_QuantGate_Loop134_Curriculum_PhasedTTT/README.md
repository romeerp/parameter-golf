Compared with PR #1736's 3-seed mean of **1.06549**, this curriculum improves the final endpoint by **0.00043 BPB** while staying under both the 600s eval budget and the 16,000,000-byte decimal artifact cap.

## Key change from PR #1736

This record keeps the same CaseOps tokenizer, byte-sidecar accounting, gated attention, quant gate, and phased TTT stack from PR #1736. The only model-side change is the recurrence schedule.

PR #1736 uses a fixed recurrent depth after loop activation. This submission instead uses a **deterministic equal-thirds recurrence curriculum**:

- once the loop path is enabled, train at total recurrence depth `1`
- then switch to total recurrence depth `3`
- then switch to total recurrence depth `4`
- evaluate and run phased TTT at fixed depth `4`

Depth here is counted as the **total number of passes through the recurrent loop block**. So `1` is the shallowest loop-enabled path, `3` is the former PR #1736-style depth, and `4` is one extra refinement pass at the endpoint.

The intuition is that this teaches a scalable refinement operator without paying the full cost of training at the deepest recurrence for the entire run. In practice, it improves the final phased-TTT endpoint even though one seed (`1234`) is slightly worse than PR #1736; the mean improves because seeds `0` and `42` improve more strongly.

## CaseOps tokenizer and legality

CaseOps (`lossless_caps_caseops_v1`) is a **bijective**, character-level text transform applied before SentencePiece training. It removes English capitalization from the body of the text and records it as four operator tokens that become part of the BPE vocabulary as SentencePiece `user_defined_symbols`:

- `TITLE` — next word is TitleCase
- `ALLCAPS` — next word or region is UPPERCASE
- `CAPNEXT` — next letter is capitalized
- `ESC` — escape for a literal operator-looking sequence

Because the transform is fully invertible, no information is lost. Reconstruction is exact by replaying these capitalization operators over the lowercase lexical stream.

**BPB is still charged on the original raw UTF-8 bytes**, not on the transformed representation. The validation export emits a per-token byte sidecar (`fineweb_val_bytes_XXXXXX.bin`) parallel to the transformed token stream. Eval sums those byte counts for the scored positions, so the denominator remains the original FineWeb byte count.

That means:

- extra CaseOps control tokens are **not free**
- they still contribute prediction loss
- but the BPB denominator stays anchored to the original corpus bytes

So the submission remains legality-preserving: it changes representation, not the underlying text being compressed.

## Rule compliance

- **Artifact <= 16,000,000 bytes DECIMAL**: all 3 seeds <= 15,986,579 bytes.
- **train_time <= 600s**: all 3 seeds are 596.10-596.15s.
- **total_eval_time <= 600s**: all 3 seeds are 470.6-513.8s.
- **Score-first TTT**: phased TTT snapshots the pre-update score on each chunk before the LoRA adapter step.
- **BPB on original bytes**: per-token byte sidecar encodes the canonical UTF-8 byte count of each val position.
- **Reversibility**: `decode_lossless_caps_v2(encode_lossless_caps_v2(x)) == x`.
- **No val data in training**: training uses only `fineweb_train_*.bin` shards.
- **No external network during eval**: self-contained; tokenizer + transform ship with the submission.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install flash-attn-interface sentencepiece triton numpy
```

Python >= 3.12 is recommended.

Run all commands below from this record directory.

## Data setup (run once)

The submission ships with the trained CaseOps SentencePiece model and the bijective transform module. Train/val shards and the byte sidecar are rebuilt from the canonical FineWeb-10B doc stream:

```bash
# 1. Ensure docs_selected.jsonl exists (standard repo setup step).
python3 ../../data/download_hf_docs_and_tokenize.py

# 2. Build CaseOps-transformed shards + val byte sidecar.
python3 prepare_caseops_data.py \
    --docs ./fineweb10B_raw/docs_selected.jsonl \
    --out  ./data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp8192_caseops/datasets \
    --sp   ./tokenizers/fineweb_8192_bpe_lossless_caps_caseops_v1_reserved.model
```

## Lineage

- Builds directly on **PR #1736** for the CaseOps tokenizer, byte-sidecar accounting, gated attention, quant gate, and phased TTT stack.
- Keeps the same legality-preserving tokenizer path from **PR #1729**.
- Replaces PR #1736's fixed recurrent depth with a deterministic `1 -> 3 -> 4` recurrence curriculum and fixed-depth-`4` eval.
